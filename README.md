# Airplane Tickets

This program prompts the user to validate which dates they want to leave and return from a planned vacation and allows the user to be able
to view and select seats.


Edit 6/19 I've gotten the program to what I'd think is complete. I am open to edits and ways of shortening and making my program more concise.

Example of current program output:
