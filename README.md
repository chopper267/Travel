# Travel

This program prompts the user to validate which dates they want to leave and return from a planned vacation.

Currently the program is not finished yet, and I am polishing it up. Eventually I'd like for there to be an option for price points for different seats on an airline.

Example of current program output:

Please enter the year:2019
Please enter the month: 6
Please enter the day of the month: 17
You are leaving on Monday the 17 of June 2019
Please enter the year you wish to return:2019
Please enter the month you want to return: 6
Please enter the day of the month you want to return: 19
